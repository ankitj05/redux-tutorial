###Basic Redux tutorial repo.

Here creating a store with 2 data points - counter, isLogged.

Counter will increment or decrement based on the actions.
isLogged is kept false, by default. Will show a line if the value is true or nothing.

3 buttons
1. '+' -- increment the counter.
2. '-' -- decrement the counter.
3. 'Sign In' -- isLogged true. Will change to 'Sing Out' when isLogged is true.
